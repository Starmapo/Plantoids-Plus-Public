Asmodie doesn't really have any motivations herself, she tags along with Taih because she loves him. Normally she lets Taih handle issues that are in his forte, but will get involved if things get too dangerous for a simple tune to fix. Little did she know she was also getting targeted by others who think they are more worthy of Asmodie than Taih.

The most popular plantoid in society! Feri is known far and wide! It's impossible to NOT know about her! Despite losing to a fresh face like Taih, her popularity just continues to increase! Just don't let anyone know she was going easy on him.

Feri's already accomplished it all, so she spends her time trying to figure out more about herself and her past, becoming a Forest Guardian... becoming Cursed... fighting various evils. She's always doing something interesting no matter when it is! Even a normal Snap Labs visit is made interesting with her around!

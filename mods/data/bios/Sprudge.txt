A smoking "Spruce Berry" as he calls himself, after hearing of someone's demise, he's come to pay respects to them, but it seems he will also have to calm down Taih who has run into him at an awkward time, low on cigars he'll have to calm Taih down so he can go and buy some more before he burns out...

Sprudge is just trying to do his own thing as of late, so he commonly avoids most social interactions. Despite this, he knew someone would've probably showed up to the alleyway as he paid his respects, he just wasn't expecting Taih.

- Sprudge prefers tobacco.
- Sprudge seems to be cursed to only be able to breathe smoke, so running out of cigars is quite lethal to him.
- In his Smoke Ghost form, and shortly after he returns to his body, he is able to breathe normal oxygen, giving him enough time to grab another cigar.

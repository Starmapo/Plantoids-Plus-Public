A rather intrusive 'Sky' Blueberry who is rather fond of Taih's praise, interupting Taih and Asmodie's picnic for a fun little singing contest that gets out of hand really quickly.

Aero's motivations are really basic, she wants Taih's praise by any legal means necessary. So when she heard Taih had defeated Feri in a singing competition, Aero started practicing immediately. After practicing to the point she felt accomplished with, she started walking around the Park (which is a common place Taih goes to) waiting for him to show up, only to see him and Asmodie arrive for a picnic. Only one thing left to do now.

- Aero is rather tall for a Blueberry Plantoid, normal ones are roughly 2'10", Aero over here is between 3 and 4 feet!
- She doesn't like failing to fit in.
- Just where did she come from anyway?

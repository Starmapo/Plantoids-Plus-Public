A cute and friendly ghost who wants what's best for everyone. He started following Taih around after Feri's defeat to learn more about him, usually getting dragged into unfortunate situtations as the 'Torn-Aero' would prove.

Fire has no desire to actually challenge Taih, he mainly follows Taih around just in case some villain attempts to cause problems for Taih. For now nothing seems to have happened so he feels at ease.

- His cause of death is unknown.
- He's really hungry. All the time.
- It's unknown if he'll ever challenge Taih again. But if he does, it will be different.

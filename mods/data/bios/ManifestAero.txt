A rather intrusive 'Sky' Blueberry who is rather fond of Taih's praise, as if her desires predated her own name and even her form. When brought to her lowest point or when under intense emotions, Aero will transform into this powerful yet dangerous form reminicent of someone she used to be.

Manifest Aero is a bit mindless persay, while in the form she will practically destroy anything around her in a tornado, not like she wants to. Usually the best way to deal with this is to calm her down or exhaust her energy. It's unknown if she'll ever gain control over the form.

- Tengo will usually pay for any of the damages Manifest Aero causes, usually by actually rebuilding them, such is the powers of being a god.
- If you were to mind read Aero like this, you'd just find her sitting in the dark alone.
- Her sister misses her.

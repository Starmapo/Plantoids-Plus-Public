Snarky and cocky are words that fit this Man-Made Primal Hybrid, but she's quite friendly to those around her, and friendlier to those she admires deeper. She thinks very highly of herself and is Feri's rival and friend.

Thora isn't one to talk about it but her motivations are to make herself different from the Primals she's a hybrid of. Singing is just one of those ways to do that, along with the strong belief that Feri needs a rival (and an admirer). She constantly taunts and on occasion flirts with Feri, turning what are supposed to be supply pickups into bumbling conversations.

A rather well-known Sky, this pint-sized, pow-voiced midget seems to have wandered a bit far from home, and has run into someone she thought she talked to yesterday. Might as well see what's going on!

Ski is a Sky made by Rodrigo, upon permission being given by her owner, she has arrived in Plantoids Plus in a special Skyverse themed song against Aero! Sure do hope the park won't be destroyed again...

- Aero doesn't understand the Skyverse, nor her own capabilities.
- Ski would not stand a chance against Aero's wind magics, even though they are very weak. Manifest Ski on the other hand would fare pretty well.
- She's highly explosive.
